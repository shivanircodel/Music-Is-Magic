# Music-Is-Magic
This is a project I made with my team during the Hackathon Do Re Mi II. I was responsible for doing components of the front end of the website along with the javascript website. I am just making a copy of my project in my repository as well as my teammates.

# ☁️ Inspiration
As fellow musicians and hackers, we were inspired to make a platform where people could connect over music. So many people don't have access to instruments, or can't play with others, and this platform allows them to do both.

# 📓 What It Does
The website consists of six different instruments that users can play on, consisting of the piano, drums, violin, flute, trumpet and xylophone. The website also has a `Twilio` feature which asks the user which instrument they would want to play. It also uses `Twilio` for the dial-in to listen feature, which is where anyone can call the bot, enter their concert number, and listen in. For the coins/reward system, `CockroachDB` is used.

# 🔨 How We Built It
We built both the frontend and backend on [Replit](https://replit.com/). While the frontend was made using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, the back end was made using `Python`. We made a chat and call using `Twlio` and a coinbase using `CockroachDB`, where the more you use the instruments, the more coins you receive.

# 👨🏾‍💻 Challenges We Ran Into
The instruments were definitely the most challenging part of our website. We originally wanted to implement violin and flute into our website, but we were having trouble with them, so we decided to scrap them and implement bongos and a karaoke machine instead. On top of coding issues, we were all in different time zones (one `PST`, one `EST`, and two `IST` members), so communicating/meeting was a challenge.

# 🎉 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We are proud that we were able to build a working website within 48 hours, despite two of us having school on the first day. This project was **huge**, with many components, and with our busy high school/college work, it was challenging to finish. We learned time and code management. For the domain, we ran across many issues with the `DNS Records`, but finally fixed all of them.

# 📙 What We Learned
Shivani learnt how to make `JavaScript` instruments. Utsav learnt how to use `CockroachDB`, totally from scratch. Sarvesh learned how to make *awesome* websites with `Bootstrap`. Hardik helped out everywhere, but most importantly made a very good video!
